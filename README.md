# ARRAY

Benchmark Datasets and Source Code of the Paper "ARRAY: Adaptive Double Feature Weighted Transfer Naive Bayes for Cross-Project Defect Prediction".

## Tips
(1) RQ1 folder include the results of all models on each of all 242 combinations of source and taget datasets in terms of F1, AUC, and MCC;\\
(2) RQ2 folder includes the source code of the used project.

## Experimental Environment
(1) MATLAB R2018b;\\
(2) CPUï¼šAMD Ryzen 5 4600U 2.10GHz  RAM 16GB;\\
(3) Python3.6, weka-3.8.4

## Usage of ADFWTNB
- Step1: Download ARRAY-master;
- Step2: Open MATLAB, add the path of ARRAY-master and its all subfolders into MATLAB;
- Step3: Add the absolute path of weka.jar in the subfolder ARRAY-master/ARRAY/ into the classpath.txt of MATLAB;
- Step4: Open the script Experiment.m (in the subfolder ARRAY-master/ARRAY/) with MATLAB Editor;
- Step5: Click the run button in the manu of MATLAB Editor to run the Experiment.m;
